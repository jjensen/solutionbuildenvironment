<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>The Solution Build Environment add-in uses a new file called <i>
SolutionName.slnenv</i> residing in the same directory as the solution to
provide build environment variables tailored to a given solution file.
<i>.slnenv</i> stands for &quot;solution environment.&quot; The Solution Build Environment add-in
executes this file at solution open time and before the start of each
build, resetting the build's environment variables accordingly.</p>
<p>New versions of the Solution Build Environment add-in may be found on
<a href="http://workspacewhiz.com/">http://wwhiz.com/</a> in the <b>Other Addins</b> section.</p>
<h2>Usage</h2>
<p>Inside the <i>SolutionName.slnenv</i> file, with one entry per line, are
<code>environmentvariablename=value</code> entries.</p>
<pre>MYPATH=c:\Src\MyDirectory\Include
EXTRA_OPTS=/D MY_DEFINE</pre>
<p>The solution's path is available via a variable called <code>$(SolutionDir)</code>.
The solution directory does not contain a terminating backslash.</p>
<pre>SOLPATH=$(SolutionDir)\Include</pre>
<p>The solution's name is available through <code>$(SolutionName)</code>.</p>
<pre>SOLNAME=$(SolutionName)\Include</pre>
<p>A special form of assignment is available through the <code>?=</code> 
operator.&nbsp; An assignment is only made if the environment variable does not 
already exist.</p>
<pre>-- Only assign if PATH does not already exist.
PATH ?= c:\windows</pre>
<p>Some software packages don't handle relative paths very well.&nbsp; The 
Solution Build Environment add-in has a special symbol for expanding relative 
paths into an absolute form.&nbsp; The absolute expansion of the path is 
triggered by inserting an exclamation point at the beginning of the line.</p>
<pre>RELPATH=c:\Windows\System32\..
!ABSPATH=$(RELPATH)  # c:\Windows</pre>
<p>Environment variables may be inserted  using the <code>$(EnvironmentVariableName)</code>
syntax. This has the same functionality as a batch file's <code>%EnvironmentVariableName%</code>
substitution syntax but more closely mirrors Visual Studio's syntax for 
accessing environment variables.</p>
<pre>PATH=$(PATH);c:\Tools;$(MYPATH)\..\Bin</pre>
<p>Simple registry entries may be accessed via <code>%(HKLM\Path\Key)</code> or
<code>%(HKCU\Path\Key)</code>, where <code>HKLM</code> accesses <code>
HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE</code> and <code>HKCU</code> accesses <code>HKEY_CURRENT_USER</code>.
Only string values may be retrieved.</p>
<pre>MYPATH=%(HKLM\Software\MySoftware\Path)</pre>
<p>An environment variable may be applied onto a specific Solution
Configuration. The syntax for this is <code>ConfigurationName:Name=Value</code>.</p>
<pre>Debug:PATH=$(PATH);%(HKLM\Software\MySoftware\DebugPath)
Release:PATH=$(PATH);%(HKLM\Software\MySoftware\DebugPath)</pre>
<p>Other <i>.slnenv</i> files may be included using the <code>
include</code> or <code>forceinclude</code> keywords. The filename
following each keyword should not contain the <i>.slnenv</i> extension.</p>
<p><code>include $(HOMEDRIVE)$(HOMEPATH)\MyPersonalDefinitions<br>
forceinclude ..\..\MandatoryDefinitions</code></p>
<p>Comments are specified by using <code>--</code> or <code>//</code> or <code>#</code>.</p>
<pre>-- This is a comment.
// This is a comment.
Key=Value # This is a comment</pre>
<h2>Example</h2>
<p>Assume you are building a DirectX application called Game, but the DirectX
include directory is not at the same location across different machines.
(Normally, the DirectX include directory is global, but this may not always be
the case.) This is a good example of creating a per user <code>.slnenv</code>
file. First, we put a <code>Game.slnenv</code> file in the same directory
as <code>Game.sln</code>.</p>
<pre>-- Provide a reasonable default.
DXPATH=c:\dxsdk

-- Call the user .slnenv file so it can override.  We don't use forceinclude so this is optional.
include $(HOMEDRIVE)$(HOMEPATH)\UserDXPath

-- Now, build the compile options.
COMPILE_OPTS=/I &quot;$(DXPATH)\Include&quot;</pre>
<p>The <code>UserDXPath.slnenv</code> file may look like this:</p>
<pre>-- The DirectX SDK is actually at the d:\Program Files\DXSDK directory.
DXPATH=d:\Program Files\DXSDK</pre>
<p>When the <code>Game.sln</code> file is run, the environment variable <code>
DXPATH</code> is available to it via <code>$(DXPATH)</code> and <code>
COMPILE_OPTS</code> is available via <code>$(COMPILE_OPTS)</code>. If
<code>$(COMPILE_OPTS)</code> is inserted into the Command-Line Options property
page, the build uses your DirectX directory.</p>
<h2>Technical Details</h2>
<p>Solution Build Environment was written in C++ with ATL support for the add-in.
It demonstrates the use of patching into the Solution Events and Build Events
objects. It also demonstrates additional code that may be inserted into
<code>DllRegisterServer()</code> and <code>DllUnregisterServer()</code> that
install and uninstall the add-in registry entries without additional install
scripts.</p>
<p>The build environment technique works because add-ins run in the same process space as Visual
Studio's <code>devenv.exe</code>. Builds launched from the IDE inherit the environment
of <code>devenv.exe</code>. Calling the Win32 <code>SetEnvironmentVariable()</code>
function call allows manipulation of the IDE environment. Previous to
setting the new environment variable, the old one is retrieved using <code>
GetEnvironmentVariable()</code> and stored, allowing each solution session to
work in a pristine environment.</p>
<p>The only strange part of the environment variable registration process occurs
when an environment variable is used for the Output or
Intermediate directory. Even though Solution Build Environment reconfigures
the environment per solution configuration at build time, the Output and
Intermediate directories are resolved by Visual Studio .NET <i>once</i> at
solution open time. Solution Build Environment compensates for that by reading
the <code>.slnenv</code> file at solution open time, too.</p>
<p>Applying the .slnenv file at solution open time also has benefit when
modifying a setting such as the <code>PATH</code>. The new <code>PATH</code>
will be available through the entire session, including when the solution is
run.</p>
